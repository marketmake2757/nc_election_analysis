Purpose of This Analysis
This analysis evaluates a claim made by the Election Truth Alliance (ETA) regarding the 2024
presidential election in North Carolina—specifically, the assertion that Donald J. Trump performs better
in counties with higher voter turnout compared to counties with lower turnout. ETA performs this
analysis at the precinct level, but their approach inadvertently excludes approximately 1.6 million early
votes across 33 counties because those ballots are not assigned to precincts in the state’s reporting
system. These unassigned early votes favor Kamala D. Harris (approximately 58% to 41%), creating a
measurable bias in the observed turnout–vote relationship.
Despite this bias and the limitations of their dataset, nothing in ETA’s analysis itself constitutes
evidence of election fraud or interference. Their findings can be fully explained by the structure of the
data they used and normal demographic voting patterns.

Why County-Level Analysis Is Used Here
To avoid artifacts caused by missing early-vote assignments, this analysis is conducted at the county
level, where all ballots—including early votes—are fully represented. This allows the turnout and
vote-share calculations to reflect the entire statewide electorate, rather than a reduced subset of
precinct-level data.
While Klimek et al. (2012) do not state that analysis must always be done at the highest level of
aggregation, they emphasize that fraud-related anomalies should not disappear or invert when results
are aggregated. Using county-level data therefore provides a complete and undistorted view of the
turnout–support relationship for this evaluation.

Summary of Findings
- When controlling for county-level partisan registration, turnout is not positively associated with Donald
J. Trump’s vote share. - After adjusting for registration, the partial relationship between turnout and
Trump’s support is slightly negative or near zero, consistent with demographic patterns in
higher-turnout urban and suburban counties. - No statistical signatures consistent with election
interference, ballot manipulation, or fraud appear in the county-level data. - ETA’s claim that Trump
performs better in high-turnout areas lacks necessary context: the observed pattern is fully explained
by county demographics and the exclusion of unassigned early votes, rather than by any irregularity in
the election results.
